We have to enable cgi on our apache2 server (this happend in exerc1).

since we use ubuntu the scripts used for CGI have to be placed at:
/usr/lib/cgi-bin

We cant directly run java since it dosnt support enviroment variables anymore which is where cgi places most parameters.
Instead we use a shell script to give java the needed parameters

the script is copied from the following tutorial since it comes in handy:
https://www.javaworld.com/article/2076863/write-cgi-programs-in-java.html
By Pat L. Durante 1.1.1997 title "Write CGI programs in Java"

most of the parameters arent actually used by the java programm and could just be deleted however since i dont know if there will be a continues task next week i just left them in the script.

script:test.cgi

#!/bin/bash
java     -Dcgi.content_type=$CONTENT_TYPE     -Dcgi.content_length=$CONTENT_LENGTH     -Dcgi.request_method=$REQUEST_METHOD     -Dcgi.query_string=$QUERY_STRING     -Dcgi.server_name=$SERVER_NAME     -Dcgi.server_port=$SERVER_PORT     -Dcgi.script_name=$SCRIPT_NAME     -Dcgi.path_info=$PATH_INFO   test
